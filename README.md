## Call-Ambulance 🚑 
This is an amazing project, the call ambulance is an emergency transportation network-based, easy to know ride-hailing ambulance app.  🛠✌

### INTRO 🙂

This ***📞Call Ambulance🚑.*** provides the best service of the emergency lane on the way to the hospital. Also, it gives its user the proper relief on the journey to any hospital. In our country Bangladesh Government officially launched the 999 emergency helpline. But it’s worked very slowly that’s why people get suffered. In our project call ambulance, we want to ensure that people have better emergency services in their critical moments.
